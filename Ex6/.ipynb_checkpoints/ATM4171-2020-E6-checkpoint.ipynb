    "* Cluster both the rows and columns of the data matrix and plot the kmeans loss as a function of the number of clusters. Do you see any differences between clustering days (rows) or variables (columns)? What effect does the normalization have? (Hint: you can use the Python code used in the lectures.)\n",
    "* Cluster the days into four clusters and make a confusion matrix (contingency table where the rows are the true classes, columns the cluster indices, and entries the counts). Order the rows and columns so that the sum of diagonal entries in your contingency table is maximized. Where are most \"errors\" made (if you would use your clusters as a classifier)? (Hint: use the Hungarian algorithm as shown in L6 to re-order the rows and columns of your contingency table.)\n"
