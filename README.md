# ATML
Machine Learning for Atmospheric Sciences course

The requirements for passing the course:
- [ ] passing E0
- [ ] attending "lectures"
  - [ ] writing a brief learning diary of each day
    - [ ] (1-2 paragraphs
      - [ ] what you learned
      - [ ] what you did not understand
      - [ ] how it was relevant for your work or other studies
- [ ] solving the daily problem sets
- [ ] term project (tentatively a classification task about new particle formation), a "bigger" task that covers (most of) the central course topics


- [ ] The course will have 9 contact teaching days during Mon-Fri 11.-22.5. (notice that Thu 21.5. is a public holiday!).

A typical day would be structured as follows: we would have "contact teaching" each day starting around 9:15. This would consist of couple of lectures and going through the previous day's problems and solutions. In the afternoon, you would have the chance to read stuff and do the daily problem sets. Me and/or Anna would be available in the afternoon ~during the office hours for smaller group discussions (we'll still have to figure out how to best organise this via Zoom/Moodle).
